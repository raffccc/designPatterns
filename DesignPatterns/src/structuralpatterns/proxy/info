*** Intent ***
	- Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
	
*** Applicability ***
	- Whenever there is a need for a more versatile or sophisticated reference to an object than
	a simple pointer. Commom situations:
		- Remote Proxy provides local representative for an object in a different address space
		- Virtual proxy creates expensive objects on demand
		- Protection proxy controls access to the original object, useful when objects
		should have different access rights.
		- Smart reference: replacement for a bare pointer that performs additional actions when
		an object is accessed. For example: closing and opening of database connections
