*** Intent ***
	- Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it
	
*** Applicability ***
	- There must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients
	from a well-knows access point.
	- The sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be
	able to use an extended instance without modifying their code.
	
*** Consequences ***
	- Controlled access to sole instance
	- Reduced name space
	- Permits refinement of operations and representation
	- Permits a variable number of instances
	- More flexible than class operations
