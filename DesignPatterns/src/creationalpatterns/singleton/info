*** Intent ***
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter
lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible 
interfaces.
	
*** Applicability ***
- You want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need
- You want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes,
that is, classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces.
- (Object adapter only) You need to use several existing subclasses, but it's
impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one.
	
*** Consequences ***
