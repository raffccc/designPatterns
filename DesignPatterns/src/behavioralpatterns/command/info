*** Intent ***
	- Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests,
	queue or log requests, and support undoable operations
	
*** Applicability ***
	- Parameterize objects by an action to perform. Commands are an object-oriented replacement for callbacks
	- Specify, queue and execute requests at different times.
	- Support undo. Command's execute operation can store state for reversing its effects in the
	command itself, the command interface must have an added Unexecute operation.
	- Support logging changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a system crash. Augmenting
	the command interface with load and store operations.
	- Structure a system aroud high-level operations built on primitives operations. Such a structure
	is common in information systems that support transactions.
	
*** Consequences ***
	
*** Implementation ***
	- The client is the one who configures the commands
